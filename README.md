# Advent of Code 2021

The following repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2021 challenge. Each
challenge is contained in a Kotlin script named according to the day it was made for (i.e.,
`dayXX.kts`) in the source directory. The `utilities.kt` file contains some utility functions
commonly used when writing challenge answers and testing code to verify it worked.

I _strongly_ encourage that you try to solve this for yourself before looking at my answers.

**Currently Completed Challenge**: Day 02

## Project Setup

This project is set up to work best with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://jetbrains.com/idea). It
includes file templates and run configurations for each day in the challenge.
